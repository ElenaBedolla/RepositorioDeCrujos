**Introduction**

IRIS is a university research consortium dedicated to explore the earth interior through the collection and distribution of seismologic data and when we saw that they put a lot of this data on Internet and that it is only reachable for People that work at this area so we still do necessary to create a platform that put The processed data online for everyone to understand

**Planification**

We´re going to do a distributed system that helps to detect earthquakes through the visualization of spectrograms, seismograms and statistics in real time. The system also pretends to classify earthquakes by magnitude and intensity and if time allows, we Will be doing a classification by the type of wave too.

**Why we picked this project?**

Because we want to simplify the visualization of earth tremors that IRIS registers, since it&#39;s not a very intuitive platform to use and with the raw data it restricts not so familiar with these technologies which reduce the utilization of this data base

**General Objectives**

- Create a tool that generates seismograms and spectrograms in real time from the seismic stations that are registered in IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology).
- We´re going to provide a tool for people that works in seismology with the purpose to make easier their work through the visualization of the registered events and the statistics of the earthquakes.

**What we want to show?**

We want to display the statistics, seismograms and spectrograms from the distinct seismologic stations all of this with a distributed system that lets us monitor all these data.

**What makes this project unique?**

The set of tools that the distribution system includes meaning the combination of statistics that the stations registered at Iris with a real time monitor at the same time the classification through machine learning instruments specifically supervised learning.

**Software tools:**

- Python
- Php
- HTML5
- Lighttpd
- Google Analytics
- Módulo de OBSPY
- Sublime Text
- Kate
- RabbitMQ (Optional)
- Django

**Test:**

Run the command python template\_download.py, to download the test data. And afterwards run python spectrograms.py to observe the spectrograms.

**Conclusions:**

During the acquisition of data, a series of problems arose, since an interpretation of these had to be made, given that it was necessary to evaluate whether what we were downloading would help us achieve our objective when it came to visualizing the information. Practically this part was the one that took us the longest, since several tests were carried out, in addition to a collaboration with students of the subject Introduction to geophysical exploration to support us with geoprocessing and its interpretation. In this practice the points on which they are going to work on this project were established, all this under the methodology of Extreme programming and it is with this that the documentation of it begins.
